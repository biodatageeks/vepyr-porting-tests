"""The one reader of VCF body records for repo tooling (#161, #164).

Tools that need the fixed columns of a VCF's records (CHROM, POS, ID, REF,
ALT) import this module instead of splitting lines themselves::

    from vcf_records import read_records

    for rec in read_records(Path("tests/data/<slug>/input.vcf")):
        print(rec.chrom, rec.pos)

A *body line* is any line that does not start with ``#``. Every body line must
be a tab-separated record with at least the five fixed columns and a decimal
POS; anything else (a blank line included) raises :class:`VcfFormatError`
with the file and 1-based line number. Only plain-text UTF-8 VCFs are read:
committed data-test files are never compressed.
